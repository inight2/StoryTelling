The door was kicked in. I flew back on the impact of the door. Luckily, I landed next to my trusty knife. I pick it up and threw it the moment I saw the light of their eyes. I hit one of the men and his gun fell towards my legs. As it fell, I kick the gun towards me. swiftly, I caught it on mid-air as I got up. Sadly, it was over for them the moment I laid my hands on the gun. One of them was still alive "Please don't kill me", he said. In this world I live I could not take a chance. Sorry, but you have to die. It has never been easy for me to see people die. As a young kid, I always looked up to heroes on movies. I realize that heroes do not exist here in this part of the world left behind by civilization.
